I found the default minecraft capes all over the place, but most come from: `https://github.com/ewanhowell5195/customOptiFineCapeServer/tree/main/capes/default`

# Installation

## Windows

**Must be using a version of Minecraft with Optifine on Windows**<br><br>
Download or Clone Repository<br><br>
In the /capes folder, rename a cape to (Your Minecraft Username).png<br>

<br>After Minecraft has loaded to the home screen, run ccapes.py or ccapes.exe
<br>

<br>*Must be run as administrator, as it modifies files in sys32*


## GNU/Linux

We will be using a debian-based distro, here Ubuntu (20.04 LTS).
<br><br>
You will need to have installed either Optifine from [optifine.net](https://optifine.net/home) either Forge with Optifine in the mods folder.
<br>
Download required packages from apt:
- `sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip authbind`
- (optional: `sudo apt-get -y install git`)

Download or clone the repo (eg.: `git clone https://github.com/3060ti/customcapes.git && cd customcapes`).
<br><br>
Add `~/.local/bin` to PATH:
- `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

Install Flask:
- `pip3 install Flask`

Change the owner of the hosts file to the desired user (**replace *YOURUSER* with the local user, eg.: *sabinm***):
- `sudo chown YOURUSER /etc/hosts`
- `sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak` (make a backup, just in case)

Allow users other than *root* to bind to port 80:
- `sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/80`
- `sudo chmod 777 /etc/authbind/byport/80`

Reopen the terminal, go to the directory you cloned/downloaded to and run:
- `cd customcapes` (replace with the directory you cloned/downloaded to)
- `python3 ccapes_linux.py`

Open Minecraft with Optifine/Forge with Optifine, join a server and voil√†!


# Capes

Capes must be stored in the /capes folder
<br>
Any custom capes must use the elytra texture
<br>
Anytime you change the cape while the program is running: `Settings -> Skin Customization -> Optifine Cape -> Reload Cape`


# How It Works


Optifine makes requests to `s.optifine.net` with the Username of the account that it's trying to load the cape from.
<br>
For example: `s.optifine.net/capes/notch.png`, would return the png of the cape for that account
<br>
We modify the hosts file, which redirects `s.optifine.net -> 127.0.0.1`
<br>When Optifine tries to load the cape, our local server responds instead: `127.0.0.1:80/capes/notch.png` with the custom cape for that filename
